		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGoPN3WOBxU"><img style="float:right;" border="10" src="https://www.litbug.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Revolt-of-1857-causes.jpeg"></a>
		The revolt of 1857 was the conscious beginning of the Independence struggle against the colonial tyranny of the British. There are various names for the revolt of 1857 – India’s First War of Independence, Sepoy Mutiny, etc.

The revolt began on May 10, 1857, at Meerut as a sepoy mutiny. It was initiated by sepoys in the Bengal Presidency against the British officers.

This war of Independence marked the end of rule by the British East India company. Post this, India was directly ruled by the British government through representatives known as Governor-General.
 <big><b>The Main Reason</b></big><br>
 The immediate cause was the introduction of the ‘Enfield’ rifle. The cartridge had to be bitten off before loading it into the gun. Indian sepoys believed that the cartridge was greased with either pig fat or made from cow fat. This was against the Hindu and Muslim sentiments. Thus they were reluctant to use the ‘Enfield’ rifle. 
 This was a flashpoint to enrage the soldiers against the British. This was believed to be the immediate factor for the revolt of 1857.<br>
 <big><b>Effects of 1857 Revolt</b></big><br>
 The revolt of 1857 was not a success but created a huge impact on India. The major impact was the abolishment of the East India Company, 
 India was under the direct control of British authority, The Indian administration was directly controlled by queen victoria. The second 
 impact that the revolt of 1857 created was to develop unity & patriotism among the nation. 
 Press was restricted since the Revolt of 1857 involved the Peasants as well. The press played an important role in the freedom struggle. It helped to educate Indians, influence them & aware of government policies.<br>
<big><b>Historical Movements of the Revolt of 1857</b></big><br>
 There were many historical movements during the Revolt of 1857 which are still the centres of conversations when we talk about our Independence struggle.
<br>
<b>Mangal Pandey</b>– Mangal Pandey did not just refuse to use cartridges greased with cow or pig fat, he created an uproar within his Infantry which led to injuring the British generals. His bravery is unmatched to date though he was hanged by the East India Company.
<br><b>Cawnpore Massacre</b>– Cawnpore or Kanpur was the highlight of the Revolt of 1857. When Cawnpore was sieged by the sepoys, they allowed the British rescue party to travel to Allahabad through Cawnpore. But the British soldiers and civilians (including 120 women and children) were killed by the sepoys. 
This enraged the East India company who tortured, looted the Indian civilians and executed a large number of sepoys in Cawpore and recaptured the city. 
<br><b>Rani of Jhansi’s historic win</b>– Rani Laxmibai refused the East India Company to annex Jhansi. The British forces then slowly marched towards Jhansi. It was in the darkness of the night that the rebels attacked the fort where the British leaders and their servants were resting and killed all of them.<br>
<br><big><b>	Failure of Revolt of 1857</b></big><br>
The revolt was an extraordinary event in Indian history, the result of the revolt was unsuccessful due to some major drawbacks. Here are all the reasons for the failure of the revolt of 1857:

One of the reasons for the failure of sepoy mutiny that there was no leader. The need of that moment was a leader that could lead & execute the plan.<br>
At some places, only sepoys were revolting & there was no support from the commoners. There was a lack of support from people in the revolt of 1857.
<br>Rulers of Indian states did not support the Indians & suppressed the revolt.
<br>There was no unity, the northern region was active in the revolt of 1857 while the southern states didn’t take any part.
<br>At that time the Indians involved in the revolt had limited resources in terms of financial aid, equipment & guns. On the other hand, Britishers didn’t face any issue like this	
<br><big><b>Aftermath of the Revolt of 1857</b></big><br>
<b>End of Company Rule: </b>The revolt marked the end of the East India Company’s rule in India<br>
<br><b>The direct rule of the British Crown:</b> India came under the direct rule of the British Crown. This was announced by Lord Canning at a Durbar in Allahabad in a proclamation issued on November 1, 1858, in the name of the queen. 
<br><b>Religious Tolerance: </b>The British Crown promised religious tolerance and customs and traditions of India were given more attention.<br>
<b>Administrative Change:</b> The governor general’s office was replaced by that of the Viceroy. <br>
<b>Military Reorganisation:</b> The ratio of British officers to Indian soldiers increased but the armory remained in the hands of the English to end the dominance of the Bengal army.
